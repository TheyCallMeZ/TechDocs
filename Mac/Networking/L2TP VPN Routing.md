If you are connecting to a L2TP VPN (and this could apply for other VPNs as well)

Open your system settings
Click on Network
In the bottom right hand corner Click the dropdown box with the three ellipses.
Select "Set Service Order"
Find your VPN profile in the list and either move it up to the top or above your other connections.
